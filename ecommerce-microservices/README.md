# E-Commerce Platform (Microservices Architecture)

This is a Microservices implementation of an E-Commerce platform built using the twelve-factor application methodology, designed to showcase modern cloud-native practices.

## Architecture Overview

This system implements a microservices approach with these components:
- Product Service
- Order Service
- Payment Service
- Inventory Service
- Notification Service
- API Gateway
- Kafka Event Bus

## Twelve-Factor Implementation

Each microservice in this project follows the twelve-factor principles:

1. **Codebase**: Each service has its own codebase tracked in Git
2. **Dependencies**: Explicitly declared via Gradle/Maven dependency management
3. **Config**: Environment variables stored in Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets
4. **Backing Services**: Each service connects to its resources via URLs
5. **Build, Release, Run**: Distinct stages managed by CI/CD pipeline
6. **Processes**: All services are stateless and share nothing
7. **Port Binding**: Services self-contained with embedded servers
8. **Concurrency**: Horizontal scaling via Kubernetes
9. **Disposability**: Fast startup, graceful shutdown with health checks
10. **Dev/Prod Parity**: Containerization ensures environment consistency
11. **Logs**: Services write logs to stdout/stderr for collection
12. **Admin Processes**: One-off processes run as Kubernetes Jobs

## Development Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Start local development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Build all services
./gradlew build

# Run a specific service locally
cd product-service && ../gradlew bootRun
```

## Deployment

This application can be deployed to multiple environments using Kubernetes:
- Development cluster
- Staging cluster
- Production cluster

Each service is independently deployable through its own CI/CD pipeline while maintaining clear boundaries and responsibilities.
