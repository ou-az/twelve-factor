## Architecture Overview

The implementation follows an event-driven architecture with three primary components:

1. **Event Producer**: Generates and publishes product-related events to Kafka
2. **Event Processor**: Consumes events from Kafka and performs real-time analytics
3. **Event Simulator**: Continuously generates realistic user interaction events

### Key Components

- **Event Models**: Structured event schema for product interactions
- **Kafka Topic**: Message broker for event distribution
- **Producer Configuration**: Serialization and delivery settings
- **Consumer Configuration**: Concurrent event processing setup
- **Analytics Engine**: Real-time metrics calculation system

## Implementation Details

### 1. Event Model Design

We designed a flexible `ProductEvent` class that can represent multiple types of events:

```java
@Data
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
public class ProductEvent {
    // Event common properties
    private String eventId;
    private String eventType; // VIEW, SEARCH, PURCHASE, REVIEW, etc.
    private Long productId;
    private String productName;
    private String userId;
    private LocalDateTime timestamp;
    
    // Additional metadata and event-specific properties
    private String userAgent;
    private String ipAddress;
    // ... additional fields
}
```

This approach allows a single Kafka topic to handle multiple event types while maintaining type safety.

### 2. Kafka Configuration

The Kafka infrastructure is configured with:

- **Topic Creation**: Automated topic creation with appropriate partitioning
- **Producer Factory**: Configured for JSON serialization of events
- **Consumer Factory**: Set up for parallel processing with multiple concurrent consumers
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management for failed event processing

```java
@Configuration
public class KafkaConfig {
    // Bootstrap server configuration
    // Topic definitions with partitioning
    // Serializer/deserializer setup
    // Producer factory configuration
}
```

### 3. Event Producer Implementation

The producer service handles event publication with non-blocking completable futures:

```java
@Service
public class ProductEventProducer {
    private final KafkaTemplate<String, Object> kafkaTemplate;
    
    public CompletableFuture<SendResult<String, Object>> publishProductEvent(ProductEvent event) {
        // Handle event publication with callbacks
        // Implement logging and error handling
    }
}
```

### 4. Event Consumer Implementation

The consumer processes events in real-time with concurrent listeners:

```java
@Service
public class ProductEventConsumer {
    // In-memory analytics storage
    
    @KafkaListener(topics = "#{kafkaConfig.PRODUCT_EVENTS_TOPIC}")
    public void processProductEvent(ProductEvent event, ...) {
        // Process incoming events
        // Update real-time statistics
        // Handle event-specific logic
    }
}
```

### 5. Continuous Event Simulation

The simulator generates a continuous stream of realistic events:

```java
@Component
@EnableScheduling
public class ProductActivitySimulator {
    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 2000) // Generate events every 2 seconds
    public void generateProductEvents() {
        // Fetch products from database
        // Generate random user activity events
        // Publish events to Kafka
    }
}
```

## Data Flow Explanation

1. **Event Generation**: The `ProductActivitySimulator` continuously creates random product events (views, purchases, reviews) every 2 seconds.

2. **Kafka Publishing**: Events are serialized to JSON and published to the Kafka topic with the product ID as the key for partitioning.

3. **Parallel Consumption**: Three concurrent Kafka listeners process incoming events from potentially different partitions.

4. **Real-time Analytics**: As events are consumed, in-memory analytics are computed and periodically logged:
   - Product popularity metrics
   - User activity statistics
   - Event type distribution

5. **Event-Specific Processing**: Custom logic is applied based on the event type (purchase, view, review).

## Real-time Analytics

The implementation calculates several real-time metrics:

1. **Event Type Counts**: Tracking the distribution of different event types
   ```
   VIEW events: 157
   PURCHASE events: 42
   REVIEW events: 31
   ```

2. **Product Popularity**: Most viewed products based on real-time data
   ```
   Product ID 3: 78 views
   Product ID 1: 65 views
   Product ID 5: 49 views
   ```

3. **User Activity**: Most active users across events
   ```
   User user123: 85 activities
   User shopper789: 63 activities
   User customer456: 52 activities
   ```

These analytics demonstrate the power of real-time stream processing for business insights.

## Testing the Implementation

To observe the Kafka event streaming in action:

### 1. Start the Docker Environment

```bash
# From the project directory
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 2. Observe Event Production and Consumption

```bash
# Watch application logs for events being produced and consumed
docker logs -f product-service-app
```

You should see continuous output showing events being generated, published, and processed, with periodic analytics reports.

### 3. Explore Kafka Topics and Messages

- Open the Kafka UI at http://localhost:8090
- Navigate to Topics â†’ product-events
- Examine the messages being published in real-time
- Note the message structure, headers, and key/value pairs

### 4. Test API Integration

The event stream is also triggered by user interactions with the API:

```bash
# Create a new product via the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/products \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name":"Advanced Microservices",
    "description":"Guide to building scalable microservices",
    "price":59.99,
    "categoryId":1,
    "stockQuantity":50
  }'
```

This will generate additional events that you can observe in the logs and Kafka UI.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

This implementation showcases several advanced skills relevant to enterprise Java development:

1. **Kafka Integration**: Configuration and usage of Kafka for event streaming
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Design patterns for loosely coupled systems
3. **Real-time Processing**: Stream processing techniques for immediate insights
4. **Concurrent Programming**: Parallel event consumption with proper synchronization
5. **JSON Serialization**: Handling complex objects in distributed systems
6. **Scheduled Tasks**: Automated processes for system continuity
7. **Spring Framework**: Advanced Spring features (Kafka, Scheduling, Dependency Injection)
8. **Error Handling**: Robust error management for distributed processing

## Enterprise Scalability Considerations

The implementation is designed with enterprise scalability in mind:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple consumers can be deployed across nodes
2. **Topic Partitioning**: Events are partitioned by product ID to allow parallel processing
3. **Stateless Processing**: Consumers don't maintain state between events
4. **Error Resilience**: Failed events don't affect overall processing
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging for system monitoring

For production environments, consider these enhancements:

- **Schema Registry**: For formal event structure management
- **Kafka Connect**: For integration with external systems
- **Persistent Analytics Store**: Replace in-memory with Redis/Cassandra
- **Kafka Streams**: For more complex analytics processing
- **Dead Letter Queue**: For handling failed event processing

This Kafka implementation demonstrates advanced event streaming capabilities using industry-standard patterns. The continuous event simulation provides a realistic demonstration of how event-driven architectures handle real-time data processing at scale, making it an excellent showcase for positions requiring Kafka and streaming technology expertise.
